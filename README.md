# ciphers

A library of interactive programs to solve and break classical ciphers in cryptology. Originally written for the Great Cipher Challenge 2020, a nationwide cryptology competition for students across the United States. More programs have been added to this library in addition to the content displayed on the competition website at https://greatcipherchallenge.org/tools/. 

Please note that this library is still a work-in-progress. There are many ciphers that could potentially be added to this library that have not yet been implemented (e.g. Hill Cipher). 

 If you have a suggestion for a cipher that could be implemented, don't hesitate to reach out! Please email clubcryptology@gmail.com or text 650-468-8850 with your suggestions.
