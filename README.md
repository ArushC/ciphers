# ciphers

A library of interactive programs to solve and break classical ciphers in cryptology. Originally written for the Great Cipher Challenge 2020, a nationwide cryptology competition for students across the United States. Many more programs have been added to this library in addition to the content displayed on the competition website at https://greatcipherchallenge.org/tools/. 

This library is a permanent work-in-progress! There are many ciphers that could potentially be added to this library that have not yet been implemented (e.g. double transposition, homophonic substitution, keyed Vigenere). 

 If you have a suggestion for a cipher that could be implemented, don't hesitate to reach out! Please email clubcryptology@gmail.com or text 650-468-8850 with your suggestions.
